# N-ways to GPU programming
The N-Ways to GPU Programming Bootcamp covers the basics of GPU programming and provides an overview of different methods for porting scientific application to GPUs using NVIDIA® CUDA®, OpenACC, standard languages, OpenMP offloading, and/or CuPy and Numba. Throughout the bootcamp, attendees with learn how to analyze GPU-enabled applications using NVIDIA Nsight™ Systems and participate in hands-on activities to apply these learned skills to real-world problems.

## Bootcamp contents:

The content is structured in multiple options covering the following: 

- Option 1: N-Ways to GPU Programming-C-Fortran
  - NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems
  - NVIDIA® Nsight™ Compute (Optional, lecture only)
  - Lab 1: ISO C++ and ISO Fortran
  - Lab 2: OpenACC
  - Lab 3: OpenMP offloading
  - Lab 4: CUDA
  - Lab 5: Memory Coherent Architectures

- Option 2: N-Ways to GPU Programming-Python
  - NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems
  - NVIDIA® Nsight™ Compute (Optional, lecture only)
  - Lab 1: CuPy
  - Lab 2: Numba

## Tools and frameworks:

The tools and frameworks used in the bootcamp are as follows:
- [NVIDIA HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk)
